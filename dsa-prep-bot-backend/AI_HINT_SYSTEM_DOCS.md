## üéì AI Learning Methodology

### **Progressive Disclosure**
The AI system uses progressive disclosure to avoid overwhelming beginners:

1. **Level 1**: Builds foundational understanding
2. **Level 2**: Introduces specific techniques  
3. **Level 3**: Provides implementation details

### **Personalization Factors**
The AI considers multiple factors when generating hints:

- **Problem Difficulty**: Adapts explanation complexity
- **Your History**: Considers previous hint patterns
- **Struggling Areas**: Focuses on your weak points
- **Learning Style**: Adjusts based on your preferences

### **Context Integration**
- **Problem Context**: Understanding of constraints and requirements
- **User Context**: Your previous attempts and progress
- **Conversation Context**: Builds on previous hints in the thread

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **AI Model**
- **Engine**: Google Gemini Pro
- **Prompting**: Structured prompts for consistent quality
- **Fallback**: Static hints when AI is unavailable
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects API quotas and Discord limits

### **Data Integration**
```javascript
// AI considers:
{
  problem: {
    title: "Two Sum",
    difficulty: "Easy", 
    topics: ["Array", "Hash Table"],
    description: "Find two numbers that add up to target"
  },
  user: {
    previousHints: 3,
    strugglingAreas: ["hash tables", "optimization"],
    solvedProblems: 45
  },
  context: {
    level: 2,
    conversationHistory: [...],
    attemptedCode: "user's code"
  }
}
```

## üìä Analytics & Tracking

### **User Statistics**
The system tracks AI usage for insights:

```javascript
userStats: {
  hintsRequested: 15,
  aiHintsUsed: 12,        // Successfully AI-generated
  fallbackHintsUsed: 3,   // When AI unavailable
  codeAnalysisRequested: 5,
  aiCodeAnalysisUsed: 4,
  lastHintRequestAt: "2025-09-25T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### **Performance Monitoring**
- AI response success rate
- Average response time
- Fallback usage statistics
- User satisfaction metrics

## üéØ Example Learning Journey

### **Beginner User - "Two Sum" Problem**

**Level 1 Hint:**
```
ü§î Think about what information you need to remember as you iterate through the array. 
What if you could instantly check whether you've seen a number that would complete the sum?

üí° Key Question: What data structure gives you O(1) lookup time?
```

**Follow-up Question:** "What's O(1) lookup time?"
```
ü§ñ Great question! O(1) means constant time - no matter how big your data gets, 
the lookup takes the same amount of time. Think of it like a dictionary where 
you can instantly find any word rather than reading page by page.

For programming: HashMap/Dictionary gives O(1) lookup, while Array scanning is O(n).
```

**Level 2 Hint:**
```
üéØ Use a HashMap to store numbers you've seen along with their indices. 
For each number, check if (target - current_number) exists in your HashMap.

Approach:
1. Create empty HashMap
2. For each number: check if complement exists
3. If yes: return indices; if no: add current number to HashMap
```

### **Advanced User - "LRU Cache" Problem**

**Level 3 Hint:**
```
üö® This requires combining HashMap + Doubly Linked List for O(1) operations:

Key Insights:
‚Ä¢ HashMap: O(1) key lookup to find cache entries
‚Ä¢ Doubly Linked List: O(1) insertion/deletion for LRU ordering
‚Ä¢ Dummy head/tail nodes: Simplify edge case handling

Implementation Strategy:
1. HashMap maps keys to linked list nodes
2. Move accessed nodes to head (most recently used)
3. Remove from tail when capacity exceeded

Time: O(1) for both get() and put()
Space: O(capacity)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### **Environment Variables**
```bash
# Required for AI functionality
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
